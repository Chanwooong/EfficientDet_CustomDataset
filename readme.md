# EfficientDet + CustomDataset + albumentations

This project is customizing the [effiecientdet](https://github.com/zylo117/Yet-Another-EfficientDet-Pytorch) of the Pytorch version.

Dataloader was modified to suit custom data(such as necklace...), and [Data Augmentation library](https://github.com/albumentations-team/albumentations) was also applied.
